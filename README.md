# Implement-browser-history
Led the planning and execution of a console-based Browser History management system using the C programming language. The system mimicked the core behavior of a real browser's back and forward history functionality, built using linked list data structures.

The goal was to develop a lightweight, menu-driven program where users could:

Visit new URLs

Navigate back and forward through browsing history

Display full browsing history

Exit the browser safely



---

ðŸ”¹ Key Responsibilities:

âœ… Requirement Analysis:
Gathered and documented functional requirements (visit site, go back, go forward, clear history).

âœ… Task Breakdown & Delegation:
Divided the project into 3 modules:

1. Linked list logic for browser history


2. Menu-driven interface


3. History tracking and memory management



âœ… Progress Monitoring:
Used excel to track development progress and weekly status updates. Held daily 10-minute check-ins to resolve blockers.

âœ… Code Reviews & Testing:
Assisted in reviewing code for logical flow and edge case handling (e.g., trying to go back when at the start of the history). Ensured consistent naming and commenting across modules.

âœ… Documentation & Final Presentation:
Compiled user instructions and created a flow diagram showing how the back/forward logic worked. Helped in the final walkthrough/demo session.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome / Achievements:

Successfully implemented a functioning browser history navigation system using singly and doubly linked lists.

Achieved clean memory management by avoiding memory leaks through malloc/free management.

Completed project 2 days before the deadline, allowing extra time for polishing and testing.

Improved team communication and task tracking efficiency.
